How this UI handles the 'Execute' button could work a couple different ways...

1.  Execute actually submits the predicate with a 'PUT' to our backend service,
    and immediately executes a 'GET' to get the output, and finally a 'DELETE'.
    This wouldn't be the fastest or most efficient, but at least we only have 1
    implementation of our application...
2.  The implementation of the PredicateEvaluationService is somehow exported
    to the client-side so it can execute locally in the browser.  This would
    avoid the blatent API abuse of #1.

The 'Save' button is a lot more simple... it invokes the 'PUT'/'POST' API.
