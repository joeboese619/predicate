# Project Title

Implementation of predicates service

## Deliverables
As a Solutions Architect, you met with a group of stakeholders today and was represented with the following UI diagram for a Conditions Builder module.  You are asked to familiarize yourself with the ServiceNow platform and provide architectural and/or system design artifacts for re-implementing this module with the following NFRs in mind (usability, robustness, scalability, performance, availability).  The artifacts should include the redesigned UI, the kinds of APIs that should be considered for interacting with the UI, the structural DB schema (optimized for MariaDB) that would meet the NFRs, and some cost:benefit analysis supporting the suggested implementation strategy.  You are welcome to provide prototype code in Java (targeting OpenJDK8.0) for any portion of your implementation (our stack is CentOS6/7 / RHEL + OpenJDK8 + Tomcat + MariaDB).  Please create and provide access to a code/document repository of choice for sharing your progress and artifacts.
